# parking-lot-search

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 4fc0139: Add the initial official Data.go.kr based public parking lot search package and skill.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- e165654: Fix parking lot lookups after Data.go.kr enforced HTTPS on `api.data.go.kr`.

  - Switch the official API URL from `http://` to `https://` so callers that use `buildOfficialParkingLotApiUrl` / direct-API mode no longer hit the HTTP → HTTPS 301 redirect that broke Node `fetch` based clients.
  - Recognize the upstream's camelCase `insttCode` / `insttNm` provider fields in addition to the previously-handled snake_case variants so `providerCode` / `providerName` stay populated.

## 0.1.1
